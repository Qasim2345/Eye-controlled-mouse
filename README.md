# Eye-controlled-mouse
The purpose of this project is to make a mouse which is controlled using eyes.The purpose of this Project is to create an application called "Eye Controlled Mouse" that allows users to control the mouse cursor using their eye movements. The code utilizes computer vision techniques and libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect facial landmarks, particularly the landmarks corresponding to the eyes. By tracking the position of these landmarks in real-time, the code calculates the screen coordinates for the mouse cursor. As a result, when the user moves their eyes, the cursor will move accordingly on the screen. Additionally, the code includes a feature where a mouse click is simulated when the vertical distance between specific landmarks representing the left eye region falls below a threshold value, indicating a blink or eye closure gesture.
Overall, the purpose of this code is to demonstrate a basic implementation of eye tracking as a means of controlling the mouse cursor, offering an alternative input method for individuals with limited mobility or for those who want to explore novel interaction techniques.
